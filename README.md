Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

*/


/* 3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Use otu_ids for the x values.
Use sample_values for the y values.
Use sample_values for the marker size.
Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
Use otu_labels for the text values.

*/

/* 4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information. */

/* 5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page. */
